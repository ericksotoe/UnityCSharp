Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.
At least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

Could try punching my way through. Or Sneaking the long way to the
emergency exit.

What should I do?
1. Take them ehad on - rush the 10 guards.
2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit
